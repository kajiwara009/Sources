You have a certain amount of money to give out as a bonus to employees.  The trouble is, who do you pick to receive what bonus?  You decide to assign a number of points to each employee, which corresponds to how much they helped the company in the last year.  You are given an int[] <b>points</b>, where each element contains the points earned by the corresponding employee (i.e. points[0] is the number of points awarded to employee 0).  Using this, you are to calculate the bonuses as follows:
</p>

<p>
- First, add up all the points, this is the pool of total points awarded.<br></br>
- Each employee gets a percentage of the bonus money, equal to the percentage of the point pool that the employee got.<br></br>
- Employees can only receive whole percentage amounts, so if an employee's cut of the bonus has a fractional percentage, truncate it.<br></br>
- There may be some percentage of bonus left over (because of the fractional truncation).  If n% of the bonus is left over, give the top n employees 1% of the bonus.  There will be no more bonus left after this.  If two or more employees with the same number of points qualify for this &quot;extra&quot; bonus, but not enough bonus is left to give them all an extra 1%, give it to the employees that come first in <b>points</b>.
</p>

<p>
The return value should be a int[], one element per employee in the order they were passed in.  Each element should be the percent of the bonus that the employee gets.
